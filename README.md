# PacMen Exercise

In this exercise, manipulate the movements of PacMan across the browser window. Then create PacMen with the click of a button and each of them will move about the browser at their own pace.

To setup on your machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/valdanite/pacmen-exercise.git
```

Open index.html to run this project.

# Future Improvements
* Add random colors to PacMen as they move around the browser.
* A pause button to stop PacMen from jumping everywhere.
